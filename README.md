# fuzzyParse
An Approximate string matching function that takes a cvs list and a search string and returns the closest match from list. It's fuzzy, and lightweight making it easy to integrate quickly inline javascript code.

The javascript file contains a list of weatherIcon codes as an example case to select the best match icon code from the list using a given search string (eg. a weather description from a weather service API).

The function could be adapted for other 'fuzzy' searches. Accuracy is NOT guaranteed, or implied. Use at your own risk.
